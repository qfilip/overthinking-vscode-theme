# Overthinking
## Overthinking is a dark theme for VSCode with saturated colors.

This is the theme I've been experimenting with as I've been journeying through Javascript, React, HTML, CSS, and Python. It's based on Juicy from Rainglow by Dayle Rees. If you come across any weird issues or have suggestions, file an issue!

**Enjoy!**
